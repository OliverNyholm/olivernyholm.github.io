                        <u>TLDR:</u> With help of an <b>Influence Map</b> that could modify a navmesh in runtime, a <i>God AI</i> would send troops in formation
                        towards a fortress with a goal of breaching the defense and attacking it's runestone.

                        and create our webpages. I put around 80 hours into the specialisation.

                        When deciding on what I wanted to do for my specialisation, I knew it was AI. But what I wanted to do was unknown. I was in this 
                        spotify period where I was mostly listening to soundtracks from <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>World of Warcraft</i>. This 
                        inspired me, with the picture of Uruk-hais attacking Helm's Deep, to create a "<i>God AI</i>" that could send units running in formation,
                        trying to breach a fortress. I wanted to make something that looked neat.

                        As a reference for formations, I looked a bit into how <i>Age of Empires</i> troops would run around. I started out with simple formations,
                        and decided not to work on them much more as it wasn't a huge focus for my specialisation.

                        The god AI didn't have a Saruman telling weakpoints in the defence and ladders to climb over walls with. I needed something for the AI to figure out
                        which part of the defense was weak and better to attack. To do this, I needed some data to read from when "learning". The solution 
                        would be to use an influence/heat map to collect data from.
                        I created a grid for the <i>Influence Map</i> to store data whenever a unit damage an object, a unit died or an object was destroyed.
                        This data was transported via a postmaster system that I also created for the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After each attack made by the god AI, the influence map would place out navmesh modifiers on areas that are unwanted or prefered to walk upon.
                        After placing, the influence map would rebake the navmesh in runtime, creating these areas.

                    <p>
                        Although I've had issues with Unity's navmesh in the past, I decided to use it as it would save me a lot of time. The scene had two navmeshes, one for 
                        the formation generals that would move the formation, and one for the units to walk upon. The difference would was for the formation generals 
                        navmesh, as it was for a broader agent and would rebake depending on the influence maps data.
                        When rebaking the navmesh, the troops would either avoid and walk around areas where they have taken a lot of damage, or walk through that area 
                        where there has been success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unity however didn't have an option to calculate the cost of a path with the areas crossed, so I had to do that calculation myself,
                        with help of the influence objects placed by the influence map. At each corner of the path to available targets, I would raycast to the next
                        corner when calculating the length, addind modifier values depending on the area cost.

                        The <i>God AI</i> would do the grind work. It would tell the influence map to bake the navmesh, send out troops and do data calculations.
                        The AI would send out two formation generals with 30 units each to the best target. The calculation of the best target was most definitely the part
                        that took the longest to work on. There were a lot of numbers and different "fitness" values that needed to be tweaked. And then I was a bit silly 
                        and created a big map, which could have long distances to run. This could result in longer simulation times.

                                Least amount of failure was the score given when attacking an object. Damaging would give bonus to the target, while dying would 
                                reduce the score.

                                Biggest threat was given to towers that attacked back. When they killed a unit, they were given a threat score. If they had killed many,
                                it was important to try destroy it.
                            </li>

                                Most damaged was simply the current health percentage of the target, with a multiplier of the value of the target.

                            <li>
                                Highest value was given to objects with importance. Walls were low prioroty, while the rune stone has the most.

                                Best area value was calculate from the influence map. From the targets position, the area around it would determine if there had between
                                success in that region before. Or failure...
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finally, the cost of moving to the object was taken into consideration. With the influence on the navmesh, some paths were considered 
                                "long" to walk and had a lower priority than paths where there had been success.

                        Whenever the troops succeeded or failed (they all died), the God AI would do a new calculation to determine which target to attack.
                        The algorithm was as follows. Influence Navmesh -> Rebake Navmesh -> Calculate best target -> Send out Troops -> Wait for result.

                        As my main focus wasn't formations, I started of creating them early with simple positioning and didn't work much more on them afterwards.
                        I had a <i>Formation General</i> that handleded the pathfinding to targets. The formation general had a list of units, and depending on which 
                        formation the general used, it determined their positioning and made them move to those positions. I tried a bit with steering behaviours making them 
                        avoid each other, but decided to only use it while attacking, as it looked better and more smooth when they could clip into each other when running alone.

                    <p>
                        Unity has a built in Agent obstacle avoidance, but I turned it off as it freaked out the general when the units were close by, which was always.
                        This caused units to detect obstacles only when close by, trying to move around them afterwards.
