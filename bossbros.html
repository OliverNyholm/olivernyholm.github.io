                        BossBros was my summer project 2018. I was inspired after a game session of PathFinder when discussing with my mate.
                        It would be fun to have a game like World of Warcrafts dungeons, but instead of having to do the boring part of trash,
                        there would only be bosses after bosses. Somewhat like The Game Bakers' <b>Furi</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had never coded networking before, but I was eager to try it. And as I was quite experienced with Unity and since  Unity has lots of 
                        tutorials, I decided to use their engine. Unfortunately, Unity decided to deprecate their old uNet system and the project was halted.
                        Also, lots of school... TGA...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I started of with some capsules, but got quickly tired of it and asked Olof if he wanted to model something to me,
                        and we agreed on creating gnomes. I always played gnomes in World of Warcraft. Master Race.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unity's system was easy to start with, but having to use if-statements for isServer, isLocalPlayer and hasAuthority quickly
                        became difficult to wrap my head around. I got to the point where I could have multiple clients connected to a host server,
                        and they could heal each other and attack a "boss", that didn't do much but run towards the players and hit. I started of with a shockwave
                        effect for the boss, but never finished it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that Unity's current networking system is deprecated, I lost some motivation to continue on the project. It would be fun to try starting
                        it from scratch again with my new knowledge, especially now that I have had the networking course in school. Unity is currently in alpha (April 2019)
                        with their current networking system and there is very little documentation. Perhaps I would try Unreal Engine again and try networking there instead. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below are two functions that the players' characters used to cast spells. There were a lot of if-statements to ensure that it was possible to spawn spells.
                        Also when I started out with this project I wasn't too concerned about making it reliable against hackers. So I let the players, only myself (<b>:(</b>), do the
                        if-checks if it was possible to spawn spells. Then I used Unity's Command system to spawn a spell on the server for all other clients, letting it do a final
                        sanity check on whom the spell should be cast upon.
                    </p>
