                    <p>
                        My name is Oliver Nyholm, I am currently a programmer student at <a href="https://www.thegameassembly.com">The Game Assembly</a>. 
                        Before starting at TGA, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with specialization in Game Development from Malmö University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a guy from the Aland Islands, Finland that somehow ended up in Malmö, and I've enjoyed living here for the past 5 years even though they have 
                        a serious shortage of good saunas. In my spare time I enjoy bouldering and playing games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of my games are created with C++, in either TGA2Ds home engine or my school group, Wizard Loafs, own engine Yellowsnow.
                        I have also created games with the legacy system XNA, now Monogames, coding in C#. My Bachelor's thesis, Madame Légume, was coded in Unity and I have also created
                        games in Unreal Engine and Love2D, a Lua 2D Engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like to explore new challenges when working, and I consider myself being a fast learner. At the Game Assembly, I often took a more responsible role
                        in the group projects, where I would assigning meetings when needed, bring up concerns and I also did a lot of support programming. 
                        Whenever something in the engine was "burning" or someone from the other disciplines could not work due to this or that, 
                        I usually stopped my work and fixed their issues first, so no one would be hindered in their work.

                        My preference of games is mainly online multiplayer games. I have spent thousands of hours playing World of Warcraft, League of Legends and 
                        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. As I dislike being bad at computer games, I end up grinding the games I play, reaching a high level in most games. 
                        Nowadays, I mostly play CSGO if I have time. <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001843180">Link to my Steam profile</a>.

                    <p>
                        I also enjoy playing single player games. The genre of single player games that I enjoy are puzzle games such as Limbo, Inside, 
                        Portal 2 and Little Nightmares.

                    <p>During the summer of 2016, I was an intern for Åland Sailing Robots, writing C++ in arch linux. My main task during the internship was to write a new navigation algorithm for the robot boat,
                     making it sail along a calculated line. When the algorithm was done, I participated in rewriting the system to a message based system.
