                        The AI characters in the <a href="ragnarsmjod.html">6th project</a> and the 7th project all used behaviour trees to do their game logic.
                        <i>Spite - Ragnars Mjöd</i> was the first project that used behaviour tree and it was all done in code. To visualize the behaviour tree, 
                        I drew all logic in <b>Paint</b> (Ouch!). This was tedious, since when I wanted to change the tree, I had to draw around in paint as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the 6th project, we implemented a visual script editor that was part of an assignment. And as we started our 7th project, I wanted to
                        implement support to create my behaviour trees in it as well. This would increase the speed of which I can work with the AI, and it would also
                        allow me to let designers tweak behaviours as well. During <b>pre-production</b>, it was implemented and upp and running!

                        After the 7th project's <b>alpha sprint</b>, I was inspired to visualize the AI characters in the editor, 
                        much how Unreal Engine does with their behaviour trees.
                        So after the first of two <b>beta</b> sprints, I added the possibility to visualize what the AI was doing in the editor.

                        The solution to do it was by sending networked messages to the script editor from the engine. The Editor exports out the nodes ID,
                        which I mapped to the behaviour nodes in engine. When they were triggered, I sent a network message with the ID of the node.
                        If the editor has a matching node, I set a count of 60 onto that script node, that counts down everytime the window is repainted.
                        The function is recursive, setting all the connected nodes count as well. Then with the count, I lerp the color and size so it is 
                        easier to visualize the flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made the connection UDP, in order for both clients to be opened and closed whenever, ignoring required handshakes and sending
                        messages back and forth.
