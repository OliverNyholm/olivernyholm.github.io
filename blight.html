                        Blight was the third project at the Game Assembly, also using The Game Assemblies Tga2D home
                        engine.
                        The projects reference game was no surprise, <b>Limbo</b>. As we needed physics for the game,
                        we implemented Box2D as our physics engine.

                        I did some pipeline programming from Unity to Tga2D and I did the AI for the game. I also
                        created
                        a wrapper for raycasting with Box2D Engine, as I find creating AI with raycasting helps a lot.
                        Actually,
                        raycasting everything helps a lot! (As long as you be careful not going to bananas with it).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The biggest obstacle I had to overcome in this project would be to make the AI pursuit the
                        player in a good way.
                        I did not want to make my level designers have to place out jump points, so I created some
                        logics for the AI to
                        get details about the environment around them.

                        This was the main update function for all the enemies. Looking back at it now, I wish I would
                        have
                        rearranged some of my code so that the check <b>IsImmobile()</b> is at the top of the update
                        function
                        returning false if the enemy is immobile. Also fixing some if-statements that are difficult to
                        read.
                        In order to make sure that the enemy would not punch away boxes, breaking the game, I added a
                        check when
                        punching making sure I would only spawn hitboxes if they are punching the air or the player.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The myAISensor was a class that handled that checks for terrain. To determine if there was a
                        hole beside the enemy,
                        the enemy had hitboxes below the feet. One to check if there was a hole, another to check if
                        there was a platform further
                        ahead that was possible to jump to. When these collisions happened, the sensor would raycast to
                        get more details about
                        how far of a jump is it, or if there was a platform beneath, safe to fall down to.

                            Here is the code how the enemies handled jumping. <b>HandleHole()</b> is as it sounds, when there
                            was a hole in front of the enemy. The designers wanted the enemies to jump if there was nothing
                            ahead of them, a way for the player to breath out having escaped the threat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>HandleTerrain()</b> was if there was a small box or little ledge in front of them. The enemy would jump on 
                            that object if that was the case.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The code for jumping is done by a distance required to jump with an angle to jump with. The jump
                            force is calculated with a projectile calculation. I believe I found something from UnityForum and used it.
